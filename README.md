# StoRM-variants
Boosting StoRM Convergence with Metric Guidance and Non-uniform State-Sampling for Optimal Dereverberation

StoRM code, data preparation utility and pre-trained model can be accessed at: https://github.com/sp-uhh/storm.

Download Selective folders containing modificationas for STORM variants as mentioned in the paper "Boosting StoRM Convergence with Metric Guidance and Non-uniform
State-Sampling for Optimal Dereverberation". 

reverb_inferencing_data contains the inferencing reverb data

So folder containing modified code can be merged with the original code and can be utilized to train storm variants.
